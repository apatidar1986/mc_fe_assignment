# Amazon Top Books React App

This project is a React application that displays Amazon's top books using data from a JSON file. It's built with TypeScript and styled-components for a modern, scalable, and maintainable codebase.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/amazon-top-books.git
   cd amazon-top-books
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Building for Production

To create a production build, run:

```
npm run build
```

This will create a `build` directory with optimized production-ready files.

## Architecture Choices

1. **TypeScript**: Used for type safety and improved developer experience.
2. **styled-components**: Chosen for component-based styling and theme support.
3. **Functional Components**: Used throughout for better performance and hooks compatibility.
4. **React Hooks**: Utilized for state management and side effects.
5. **JSON Data Source**: Books data is fetched from a local JSON file for simplicity.

## TODOs

1. Implement pagination or infinite scrolling for better performance with large datasets.
2. Add sorting and filtering options for books.
3. Implement a search functionality.
4. Add unit and integration tests.
5. Optimize images and implement lazy loading for better performance.
6. Implement error handling and loading states.
7. Add accessibility features (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation).

## Production Readiness Checklist

- [ ] Implement proper error handling and logging
- [ ] Add comprehensive test coverage (unit, integration, and end-to-end tests)
- [ ] Optimize bundle size and implement code splitting
- [ ] Set up continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline
- [ ] Implement performance monitoring and error tracking (e.g., with tools like Sentry)
- [ ] Ensure cross-browser compatibility
- [ ] Implement proper SEO meta tags and OpenGraph tags
- [ ] Set up proper caching strategies for API calls
- [ ] Implement security best practices (e.g., Content Security Policy)
- [ ] Perform thorough accessibility audit and fix any issues
- [ ] Optimize for mobile devices and responsive design
- [ ] Set up proper logging and monitoring for production environment
